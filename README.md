# EcoSphere 🌱  
*A modular environment logic system in Unity.*

This project simulates environmental interactions such as dynamic weather and plant growth using Clean Architecture principles. It is designed for portfolio purposes to demonstrate code quality, separation of concerns, testing, and scalability.

## 🔧 Features
- Modular weather states (Sunny ☀️, Rainy 🌧️, Cloudy ☁️)
- Plant lifecycle (Seed → Sprout → Mature)
- Clean Architecture: Domain, UseCases, Infrastructure, UI
- Fully decoupled and testable components
- Dependency Injection via Zenject
- Unit testing with NUnit + NSubstitute
- Data persistence (PlayerPrefs or JSON)

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Unity 2022.3+
- [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)
- NUnit
- NSubstitute

## 🚀 Goals
- Serve as a professional portfolio piece
- Showcase code readability, testability, and performance-awareness
- Modular enough to extend into other simulations or editors
